**AutoAppraiser** is a high-performance automation tool designed for **Fisch (Roblox)**. It utilizes advanced OCR techniques and fast screen capture to automate the appraisal process, allowing you to filter for specific fish mutations with extreme precision and speed.

---

## ✨ Key Features

-   ⚡ **Turbo Capture**: Supports both `DXCAM` (NVIDIA/AMD) and `MSS` for near-instant screen recognition.
-   👁️ **Windows Runtime OCR**: Leverages native Windows OCR for high-accuracy text detection without external dependencies like Tesseract.
-   🎯 **Overlay Region Selector**: A transparent, draggable, and resizable overlay to precisely define your capture area.
-   🧬 **Mutation Filtering**: fully customizable list of mutations to keep—stop automatically when you find that "Abyssal" or "Celestial" fish!
-   ⌨️ **Global Hotkeys**: Control the application (Toggle Overlay, Start/Stop, Force Exit) from anywhere using customizable keys.
-   🏗️ **Modular Architecture**: Clean, maintainable codebase designed for easy extension and updates.

## 🛠️ Usage Guide

1.  **Configure Mutations**: Navigate to the "Mutations" tab and select the ones you want to keep. You can also edit the list manually.
2.  **Set Capture Region**: Press `F3` (default) to show the capture box. Drag and resize it over the appraisal text area in-game. Press `F3` again to hide and save.
3.  **Start Automating**: Equipt your fish and press `F4` to start the auto-appraisal loop. The app will automatically click the "Appraise" button and stop once a selected mutation is detected!
4.  **Test Capture**: Press `F2` to take a snapshot and see exactly what the OCR engine is reading.

### Modular Design
The project uses a **multiple inheritance pattern**. The `AutoAppraiser` class inherits from a `Utils` aggregator, which combines functionality from all utility modules. This keeps the main application lean while providing easy access to all features.
